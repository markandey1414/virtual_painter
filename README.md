# virtual_painter
This repo contains a basic Computer Vision project on Virtual painter. Currently it has only 1 color in it (blue: (0, 0, 255). I originally designed it to be a virtual writer, but it can also be generalized as a painter.
The color picker file contains additional code in order to add more colors into the driver code.
You may simply append the BGR values into the list of myColors[] list defined at the top.
